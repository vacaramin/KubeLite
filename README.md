KubeLite is a user-friendly container orchestration platform designed for small-scale deployments keeping cluster costs low.

## Architecture

Built using http/mux router for the api server. for now

## What's different?

> Nothing is different, the implementation pattern is going to similar to k8s but simpler.

## What will I gain from this?

> I wonder about this too. Hopefully I'll understand and have insights on the underlying architecture of k8s.
